## RoME: Domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts for MILP Solution Prediction across Domains

This is the code of paper RoME: Domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts for MILP Solution Prediction across Domains. Tianle Pu, Zijie Geng, Haoyang Liu, Shixuan Liu, Jie Wang, Li Zeng, Chao Chen, Changjun Fan. NeurIPS 2025.

We apologize for the delay. We are in the process of extending our paper into a journal version, including developing a stronger model architecture and training across more domains. We will release the code as soon as possible.
